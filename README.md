This package is currently a stub for an interface for representing Dynamic Decision Networks (DDNs) in Julia.

Note that Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) are a subset of DDNs, so this package should be suitable for representing DBNs as well.

If you are interested in contributing to the design, please reach out by filing an issue or on one of the [POMDPs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPOMDP/POMDPs.jl) communication channels.
